3.Summary:

  Shark attacks across the globe have doubled in the last 20 years, according to a recent study. Lots of people enjoy spending time beside
the beaches and doing various activities, which makes them at the risk of being attacked by sharks. In order to reduce the chance of shark
attacks, we explore multiple potential factors that may affect the sharksâ€™ behavior.

4.Hypothesis:

(1) The temperature is related to the injury type(fatal or not).

(2) The activity people doing when they are attacked have a relationship with the injury type (fatal or not). 

(3) The species of shark have a relationship with the injury type (fatal or not).

5.Results:

(1) We can reject the null hypothesis that the temperature is independent to injury type.(<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha/> = 0.05)

  
(2) We can reject the null hypothesis that the activity people doing when they are attacked and the injury type are independent of each other.

(3) We can reject the null hypothesis that the species of shark and injury type are independent of each other. 

**The results of chi-square test on three hypothesis are uploaded on GitHub named as R1.png, R2.png and R3.png. We can see that, all of the p-values are pretty small (<<0.05)**
